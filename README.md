### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a high school student with a deep passion for technology and problem-solving. While most students are just learning the basics of computers, I am actively building **Full-Stack AI applications** and exploring the depths of Data Science.

My journey began with creative Web Design (HTML/CSS), but I quickly realized the power of data. Now, I specialize in **Python**, bridging the gap between front-end interfaces and back-end analytical engines. My ultimate goal is to become an **AI/ML Engineer** capable of deploying intelligent systems that solve real-world problems.

### 🚀 What I Do

* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** I transform raw datasets into meaningful insights using `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `Matplotlib`. I enjoy finding patterns in chaos.
* **GUI Development:** I build functional desktop applications using Python's `Tkinter` framework.
* **Web Design:** I craft responsive layouts using modern `HTML5` and `CSS3`.
